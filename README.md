# DungeoNes
**DungeoNes** is a game prototype developed for **NES with ASM 6502**. You can compile the source code with **NESASM3**. I'm using some .bat file to compile and run the emulator directly.

### Instructions:
Arrows keys to move the player and attack in direction of the enemy
Select to switch between Special Move 1 ( ranged attack ) and Special Move 2 ( ranged displacement ) 

### Known Issues:
This is an early prototype, so there are a lot of known issues and bugs ;). Be patient!

# Story of DungeoNes
I spent a lot of time on this project learning a lot of things on Nes Development and ASM 6502. Unfortunately this project was too ambitious and I don't have the time to finish it, but I loved every single line of code that I wrote for this project. Maybe some day I will finish it, but for now, you can download the source code and use it for your project or to learn something on Nes Development.

# What is DungeoNes
DungeoNes is a grid based dungeon crawler. 

### Classes:
You can choose from 3 class, every class has 1 special attack with a range and a teleport with a range:

* Knight, 1 cells for ranged attack, 2 cells for teleport. 
* Mage, 2 cells for ranged attack, 3 cells for teleport.
* Archer, 3 cells for ranged attack, 2 cells for teleport.

The classes can be selected by code. No UI for now, sorry! :(

### Turn and Combat System:

Every pawn into the grid move one or attack at time, you can move using the arrows keys. When an enemy is near to your cell you can attack the enemy by pressing arrow key into the direction of the enemy. You can use special attack or teleport by pressing "select" and A button. The special attack allow you to select the cell to attack or the cell to teleport.

### LevelUp and Stats:
Everytime you kill an enemy, it give you experiences points. You can so Level Up and improve your player stats. Your attack depends from your stats, every special attack add some damage ( it's a special attack! ). So the Knight can do a lot of damages with a short range, Archer had a great range, but is not really strong, the Mage can use the magic, mid-range, but really strong. 

### Dungeon Exploration:
The Dungeon is composed by rooms, when you go on a door, you can reach the next room. The rooms are descrived by an array like this:

 ```asm
 l_0_0:
 .db $12,$07,$06,$02,$06,$06,$06,$08
 .db $12,$09,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$0A
 .db $12,$09,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$0A
 .db $12,$0E,$06,$06,$06,$08,$00,$0A
 .db $12,$12,$07,$06,$06,$0D,$00,$0A
 .db $12,$12,$09,$00,$00,$00,$00,$0A
 .db $12,$12,$0E,$04,$06,$06,$06,$0D
 .db $12,$12,$12,$12,$12,$12,$12,$12
 ```
 
 in "levels_descriptor.asm". This file is generated by a tool that I made in Python. But you can edit directly into the text editor.
 
 # Documentation and Future:
I will add some other documentation step by step to help you to modify the source code and use as you prefer. But for now the source code is self explained, but has the comments in Italian (sorry!). I hope some day to finish this project. For any questions please don't esitate to contact me, I will answare you as soon as I can.
